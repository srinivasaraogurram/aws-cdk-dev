Note: I went through the above crash course, and during the interview, it will help as a quick refresher and reference. Hope it is not a content violation

One Project can only have one app, but one project can have multiple stacks within the project.

Important CDK Commands

CDK List Stack
CDK BootStack - which bootstraps
CDK Deploy - It will deploy all the resources

### CDK Help

The image shows the output of the `cdk help` command, which lists all available AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) CLI commands. Here's a breakdown of the key commands and their purposes:

---

### **AWS CDK CLI Commands**

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cdk list [STACKS..]` | Lists all stacks in your CDK app. Alias: `ls`. |
| `cdk synthesize [STACKS..]` | Generates and prints the CloudFormation template for the specified stack(s). Alias: `synth`. |
| `cdk bootstrap [ENVIRONMENTS..]` | Deploys the CDK toolkit stack into an AWS environment (required before deploying stacks). |
| `cdk deploy [STACKS..]` | Deploys the specified stack(s) to your AWS account. |
| `cdk import [STACK]` | Imports existing AWS resources into a CDK stack. |
| `cdk watch [STACKS..]` | Shortcut for `deploy --watch`, automatically deploys changes when files are updated. |
| `cdk destroy [STACKS..]` | Destroys the specified stack(s) in AWS. |
| `cdk diff [STACKS..]` | Compares the local stack definition with the deployed version or a local template file. Returns exit code 1 if differences are found. |
| `cdk metadata [STACK]` | Retrieves metadata associated with a stack. |
| `cdk acknowledge [ID]` | Acknowledges a notice so it wonâ€™t appear again. Alias: `ack`. |
| `cdk notices` | Lists relevant notices or warnings from the CDK. |
| `cdk init [TEMPLATE]` | Creates a new, empty CDK project based on a template (e.g., `app`, `api`, etc.). |
| `cdk context` | Manages cached context values used during synthesis. |
| `cdk docs` | Opens the official CDK reference documentation in a browser. Alias: `doc`. |
| `cdk doctor` | Checks your CDK setup for potential issues and provides suggestions. |

---

### **Usage Tips**
- Use `cdk synth` to preview what will be deployed without modifying AWS.
- Use `cdk diff` to see changes between your current code and the deployed state.
- Always run `cdk bootstrap` once per AWS environment before deploying any stacks.
- Use `cdk watch` during development for faster iteration.

Let me know if you'd like examples or explanations for any specific command!
